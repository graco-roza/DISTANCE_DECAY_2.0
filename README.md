# DISTANCE_DECAY_2.0


Files used to run the analysis of  **Distance decay 2.0 â€“ a global synthesis of taxonomic and functional turnover in ecological communities** by Graco-Roza et al. 2022. 

*distance_decay.R* 

This file was used to run the GLMs and Mantel tests to test the decay of community similarity along spatial and environmental distances.

*null_model.R* 

This file was used to run the null model of the functional beta diversity along space and environment.

*Final_analysis.Rmd*

This file was used to run the synthesis analysis testing the differences in taxonomic and functional mantel R, and the boosted regression trees testing slope values along multiple predictors.
